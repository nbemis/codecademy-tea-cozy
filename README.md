## Overview
This is my implementation of codecademy's 'Tea Cozy' web design challenge. Design was fulfilled utilizing stricly CSS and HTML.

### The challenge
Given a basic design layout and image spec, the challenge was to create a fictional tea shop website utilizing the skill learned thus far in the web-developer codecademy course.

## My process
This project was a part of an online fullstack roadmap by Codecademy. It is one of the milestone projects given after the introduction to Flexbox centered CSS design techniques. My solution heavly utilized the Flexbox recently learned within the course. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development
I would like to clean up the 'reactive' elements of the webpage as they are not quite perfect since there is only one breakpoint.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Cheatsheet](https://yoksel.github.io/flex-cheatsheet/#section-flex-shrink) - Flexbox cheatsheet
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) - Codecademy website used to learn coding.
