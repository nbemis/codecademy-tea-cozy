## Overview
This is my implementation of codecademy's 'Tea Cozy' web design challenge. Design was fulfilled utilizing stricly CSS and HTML.

### The challenge
Given a basic design layout and image spec, the challenge was to create a fictional tea shop website utilizing the skill learned thus far in the web-developer codecademy course.

## My process
This project was a part of an online fullstack roadmap by Codecademy. It is one of the milestone projects given after the introduction to Flexbox centered CSS design techniques. My solution heavly utilized the Flexbox recently learned within the course. Although not required, I opted to build the site with a mobile-first design approach.
Since the only specifications given were for a desktop centered website, I messed with the values intitially to create what I saw as a fitting style within a smaller viewport. Once I was satisfied with the moblie design, it was simple to change the specs in the media query to meet the desktop layout that was provided by Codecademy. Furthermore, I opted to use Flexbox with most elements on the webpage. While it definately made the process easier, I often tried to see if I could first manipulate the code to meet my needs without the assistance of Flexbox. Overall, I enjoyed figuring out how to utilize the new CSS tool and will begin to use it more often in my projects to get more familiar with its idiosyncrasies.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development
I would like to clean up the 'reactive' elements of the webpage as they are not quite perfect since there is only one breakpoint. Also, I would like to see if I can clean up the code as I was more focused on creating the design rather than creating very DRY code and perfect sematic HTML.
